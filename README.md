# Hello!

My name's Peter, and I like to code and stuff.

## Programming languages

I don't write code for a living, but I do write code as part of my job, and also for fun.

### Shell scripts

Most of the code I write is shell scripts. Why?
1. Faster to write
2. Less code
3. Most systems can run a portably-written shell script
4. If you can't write it, you can probably read it
5. Good enough for most tasks

But I'm not some crazy fanatic. There's obvious times when you shouldn't use a shell script, like:
1. When it would be better to write in a different language

I could write a book explaining when you should use what language for what purpose,
but nobody's paid me for that yet, and writing books is hard. So I haven't done that.

Instead I'll just say that the idea that *"if it's more than 100 lines of Shell, write it in Python"*
makes as much sense as *"if it's more than 100 lines of Python, write it in Lisp"*.

(*don't @ me, Lisp people.*)

#### My Shell Script Repos

 - **[Terraformsh](https://github.com/pwillis-els/terraformsh)** - This is a wrapper for Terraform. Yes, we've all written one of these. But this one is probably the best wrapper for Terraform you'll ever use. It's written to be a useful systems admin tool, unlike Terraform, and it's simple and DRY, unlike Terragrunt.
 - **[jenkins-bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/pwillis-els/jenkins-bootstrap.sh)** - Have you ever needed to set up Jenkins before? This script will do it for you - but, like, the way it **should** be set up, from the start. I hate Jenkins so much. Hopefully this saves you some time and stress.
 - **[packersh](https://github.com/pwillis-els/packersh)** - Like the Terraform wrapper, but for Packer.
 - **[attach_ebs.sh](https://github.com/pwillis-els/attach_ebs.sh)** - Ever needed to attach an EBS volume to an EC2 instance? Here's a better way.
 - **[patch-solr-log4j](https://github.com/pwillis-els/patch-solr-log4j)** - <s>If</s> When Log4j comes back, patch it quickly.
 - **[jenkins-plugin-manager](https://github.com/pwillis-els/jenkins-plugin-manager)** - Jenkins is so braindead, its "new" plugin manager can't resolve dependencies properly. This will help you manage Jenkins plugins better.
 - **[newrelic_api_cli](https://github.com/pwillis-els/newrelic_api_cli)** - Back when I was forced to use New Relic *((shudder))*, they didn't support their whole API in Terraform, so you still had to script stuff directly with their API just to create alerts triggered by two locations. I threw this together so I could script more stuff with their API.
 - **[direnvsh](https://github.com/peterwwillis/direnvsh)** - Ever wanted to run a command while inheriting environment variables recursively from a reverse hierarchy? Well now you can!
 - **[bashdag](https://github.com/peterwwillis/bashdag)** - A directed acyclic graph in Bash. (It doesn't work, because I suck at algorithms)
 - **[clinst](https://github.com/peterwwillis/clinst)** - Download and install statically-compiled programs, and then select specific versions of them to run from different directories. This is intentionally horrible to read/write, please don't read the source code.
 - **[test.sh](https://github.com/peterwwillis/test.sh)** - A minimal test framework in Shell.
 - **[shell distributed system](https://github.com/peterwwillis/shell-distributed-system)** - A toy that is unfinished. The intent is to basically rewrite Kubernetes in Shell, but this time make it not suck. Intended to showcase how to design and implement distributed systems.
 - **[repeat.sh](https://github.com/peterwwillis/repeat.sh)** - Ever wanted to run a couple commands over and over again with some added features? Now it's easier!
 - **[junkdrawer](https://github.com/peterwwillis/junkdrawer)** - Smaller scripts and junk.
 
 
### Python scripts

The rest of the code I write is mostly Python. Why?
1. Everybody else can read/write it

Python is a terrible language made by terrible people. I only use it because if
I didn't, I probably wouldn't get hired. But on the scale of tragedies in my life,
this is one of the smaller ones, so I deal. I'm halfway decent at it, but I don't
get very fancy. When I see multiple lambdas and annotations in one function, I think
of all the people in my life who have given me grief over shell one-liners...
