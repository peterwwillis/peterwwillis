ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Peter, and I write code.

I've been involved in open-source development for about 20 years.
In that time I've written custom software, started open-source projects,
and contributed to Linux distributions and other FOSS projects.
I've also created and maintained thousands of FOSS software packages
for corporate Linux distributions.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
 - [Terraformsh](https://github.com/pwillis-els/terraformsh)
 - [Palvella](https://github.com/peterwwillis/palvella)

---

Some of my projects have been lost to time, and some are closed-source,
but below is some of the FOSS stuff I could still find.
